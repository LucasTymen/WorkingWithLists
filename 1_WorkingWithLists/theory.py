Working with Lists in Python
Working with Lists

Now that we know how to create and access list data, we can start to explore additional ways of working with lists.

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to:

    Add and remove items from a list using a specific index.
    Create lists with continuous values.
    Get the length of a list.
    Select portions of a list (called slicing).
    Count the number of times that an element appears in a list.
    Sort a list of items.

Note: In some of the exercises, we will be using built-in functions in Python. If you haven’t yet explored the concept of a function, it may look a bit new. Below we compare it to the method syntax we learned in the earlier lesson.

Here is a preview:

# Example syntax for methods
list.method(input)

# Example syntax for a built-in function
builtinfuncion(input)

Instructions

Take a second to preview some of the things we will be learning by examining the graphic of common list methods and built-in functions.

When you’re ready, continue to the next exercise.
